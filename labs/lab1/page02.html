<h2>Lab Logistics and Grading</h2>

<ul class="addSpace">

<li>Each lab is like a self-paced tutorial with things for you to do.  There are occasional 
"checkpoints" which are tasks you have to show or explain to the TA.  This is how we grade your participation in lab.  When you finish the instructions in the checkpoints, just raise your hand (either in-person or in Webex) and a TA will meet with you.  (Of course, if the TA is busy, you can continue working on the next task!)

<li>At the beginning of each week (in which there is a lab scheduled), you can find the lab writeup through the Canvas Modules.

<li>If you are unable to finish all the checkpoints, you will have <strong>six days</strong> from your scheduled lab period to get your checkpoints reviewed during any of the TA office hours. Checkpoints will normally NOT be reviewed by email.  You'll need to meet with a TA and be prepared to explain your work. Effectively, the final deadline is the last TA office hour on the sixth day.  
<ul>
<li><em>But please don't wait until the last day! The TA office hours get extremely congested and there is no guarantee that a TA will be able to meet with you at the last minute.</em>
<li><em>Also remember: you won't get credit if you didn't attend the scheduled lab period in the first place.</em> 

</ul>

<h3>Attending lab</h3>
There are two options for attending each lab:
<ul class="addSpace">

<li> Physically attend during lab time in Pearson 0105/0109 and utilize the lab computers that come with Java and Eclipse pre-installed.
<li> Attend via <strong>your Webex lab session</strong> during lab time and work remotely from the comfort of your couch, bed, nearby beach, etc.  You will need to install Java and Eclipse or utilize Remote Desktop.  See the installation document in Canvas Modules for details or <a href="installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can view the instructions here.</a>

</ul>

<h3>Grading of lab work</h3>
<ul class="addSpace">
<li><strong>Attendance and participation in the labs is required</strong>, either in person or virtually.  "Attendance" means that you come at the beginning of your scheduled lab period, and work on the lab material until either you finish the checkpoints or the period ends.

<li>The labs fall under the <em>Equal Opportunity Deadline Policy</em> described in the syllabus: <strong>If you miss the lab period, or you miss the six-day deadline for having your checkpoints reviewed, it's a zero, no matter what the reason.</strong>
<ul>
<li>To allow for a broad range of emergencies, <strong>you can miss two of them without penalty</strong> (i.e., we will drop your two lowest lab scores).  There are only 8 labs in all, so this should allow you the opportunity to get sick for a few weeks if you need to.
<li>If you have an extended illness or other unusual circumstances requiring you to miss classes for multiple weeks, please discuss the situation with your professor.
</ul>

<li>The lab scores count for 8% of your final grade (so an individual lab counts for a little over 1%).  <em>However, doing the labs is strongly correlated with higher scores on exams and homework, so that should be an even better motivation!</em>
 
</ul>

<h3>Working together</h3>
While working during the scheduled lab period, you are encouraged to <strong>work together and discuss things with the other people in the meeting</strong> as well as to talk with the TAs.
You'll eventually have to complete the checkpoints individually, but the lab period is a good time to try things and ask questions.
If you are working on it outside of the lab period, collaboration is NOT allowed (of course, you can meet with any of the TAs during office hours for help).

<h3>Working ahead</h3>
If you prefer to start the lab ahead of time on your own, that is fine!  The lab writeup is posted sometime during the beginning of each week.  <strong>Just remember that the attendance rule still applies:</strong> you need to come at the beginning of your scheduled lab period to have the checkpoints reviewed by your TA.

<h3>Why do we require attendance?</h3>
If we don't, what happens is that most student procrastinate until the six-day deadline, and we end up with several hundred people trying to meet with the two or three TAs holding office hours at the end of the day.  It is physically impossible for the staff to meet that kind of demand.
