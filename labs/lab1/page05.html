<h2>Eclipse</h2>

<p>
Java programs are created by typing Java source code into text files. You can use any text editor you prefer to create these files; however, we strongly recommend that, at least at first, you use the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment). IDEs typically have many useful features that makes the process of developing programs much more efficient. These features include syntax checking, code formatting, and project management.  
</p>

<p>
The disadvantage is that IDEs provide hundreds of features and options that do not make sense to us (yet) and may cause some confusion. Do not worry, we will not use all those features initially.
</p>

<p> 
Instructions for installing Java and Eclipse on your own computer can be found
in the installation document, link #7 on our Canvas home page.
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you were unable to install Java and Eclipse, you can still do the lab!</strong>  All the lab computers in Pearson have Java and Eclipse installed already.  If you prefer to join the lab remotely, just use Remote desktop to access the CS department terminal server.  The instructions for doing this are on the last page of the installation doc.

<h2>Do I have to use Eclipse?  I like {IntelliJ, Visual Studio, NetBeans, etc} better.</h2>
It's fine if you want to use IntelliJ or VS or any other full-featured IDE.  However, it may mean some extra work for you, since the 227 staff won't be able to provide support.  But many students have done this in the past and it works out.  Just post on Piazza if you can't figure out how to do something.
