<h2>Using a SpecChecker to validate your code</h2>

Most of the time when you write code, it has to interact with libraries that 
already exist or with code that other people are writing.  For this to work, 
everybody's code has to behave according to its documented specifications.
<p>
In particular, some portion of your grade on each assignment will come from
automated tests that we run.  In order for the tests to run, your code has to
conform precisely to the specification we provide.  For most assignments, we
will give you a tool called a SpecChecker.  The main purpose of the SpecChecker
is to help you verify that your code is written according to an assignment's 
specifications.  (For example, among many other things, it will check whether the 
public method names and the types of the parameters are correct.)  

<p>
In some cases, the SpecChecker will run some functional tests of your code
and/or create a zip file for you to submit to Canvas.

<h3>Assignments</h3>
For the regular assignments, 30% to 40% of the points come from automated tests and the remainder from reading and evaluating your code.


<h3>Running a SpecChecker</h3>
Running a SpecChecker is easy, but there are some detailed steps that have to be followed.
(Most of these steps won't make a whole lot of sense at first, but we should be able
to understand them by the end of the course!)
<p>
Each SpecChecker is a small Java library called a 
"jar" file.  You download it, import it into your Eclipse project, and run it.
The step-by-step instructions are found in the SpecChecker HOWTO, link #10 on our Canvas home page:

<p>
<a href="../../docs/specchecker/specchecker.html"> <em>Open SpecChecker HOWTO</em>
</a>.

<p>

You can find a SpecChecker for your Greeter class
<a href="speccheck_lab1.jar">here</a>.

Follow the instructions in the specchecker document above to import the SpecChecker into your project and run it.  This SpecChecker
will run a simple functional test and will optionally create a zip file
for you to submit.  When you see the message
<p>
<img src="specchecker.jpg" width=380 alt="SpecChecker dialog box">
<p>
click Yes, and select a <strong>directory</strong> in which to save the zip file.  The SpecChecker will create a zip file called <code>SUBMIT_THIS_lab1.zip</code> in that directory.

<h2>Using a SpecChecker with a different IDE</h2>
Basically the SpecChecker is just a jar archive, containing a main method, that is dependent on JUnit.  You'll need to figure out how to include JUnit and the specchecker jar file in your project. There was some discussion on Piazza last semester in which some students figured this out for IntelliJ; we have reposted this as Piazza post @21.
