<h2>Backups</h2>


<p>
Although it is possible to complete Com S 227 using only the lab machines or the terminal server, most students prefer to work on their own computers.  When you work on the lab machines with a workspace on your <pre>U:</pre> drive, your work is automatically backed up on the ISU network.
<p>
When you are using your own machine, you are responsible for backing up your files yourself, preferably in a secure, network-accessible location.  <strong>Losing your work because of personal computer problems will never be accepted as an excuse for missing an assignment deadline.</strong>  

<p>
There are many ways to keep your work backed up, and we do not restrict you to any particular strategy.  Here are some ideas:
<ul>
<li>Keep a copy of your files on your "MyFiles", which is your ISU-managed network storage. Instructions to do this can be found at the end of this document.  (If you are using Remote Desktop to access the CS terminal server, then you are automatically using MyFiles.)
<li>Use the Windows 10 <a href="https://lifehacker.com/how-to-back-up-your-computer-automatically-with-windows-1762867473" target="_blank"><em>File history</em></a> feature or the Mac <em>Time Machine</em>
<li>Use Google Drive
<li>Email yourself a copy of your program each time you work on it
<li>Use a repository such as git.  (Note, however, that you can't just use github, which by default makes your repository public.  Your backup has to be private. 
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/product" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a> is fine, however.)
</ul>


The following are direct quotes from students attempting to make excuses for missing an assignment deadline:
<p>
<ul style="list-style:none">
<li>"I left my laptop at the Chicago airport"
<li>"My hard drive crashed"
<li>"My computer completely died this weekend and I lost all my files"
<li>"My screen just went dead and I had to take my laptop to Best Buy to get it fixed"
<li>"I bumped my USB drive with my knee and broke it off"
<li>"My flash drive was on the floor and got crushed when I rolled my chair back"
<li>"I forgot to submit the homework before I went home for the weekend and I won't be back to my computer until Sunday night"
</ul>
<br>
The instructor's response in all cases was, "Surely, you had your work backed up!"
</ul>

<h3>Using a remote workspace?</h3>
One possible solution is just to keep your workspace on a remote, securely maintained server such as Google Drive or your ISU MyFiles.  This works well ONLY if you are on the ISU network or if your internet connection is fast.  See the last page of this document for information about using MyFiles.
