<h2>Reading from a file</h2>



<p>
We have seen that a <code>Scanner</code> can be constructed to read from 
<code>System.in</code>, and in previous labs we have seen 
examples in which a Scanner reads its input from a String.  We can also
construct a <code>Scanner</code> to read from other kinds of input streams, and in
particular we can use a <code>Scanner</code> to read from a text file.
<p>

For example, here is a short program that reads lines of text from the console, and prints out each line with a line number in front of it.

<pre class="block">
public class LineNumberer
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    int lineCount = 1;

    while (scanner.hasNextLine())
    {
      String line = scanner.nextLine();
      System.out.print(lineCount + " ");
      System.out.println(line);
      lineCount += 1;
    }
  }
}
</pre>

With very few changes, we can rewrite the line numberer to read from a file.

<pre class="block">
package lab6;
<span style="color:red">import java.io.File;</span>
<span style="color:red">import java.io.FileNotFoundException;</span>
import java.util.Scanner;

public class LineNumberer2
{
  public static void main(String[] args) <span style="color:red">throws FileNotFoundException</span>
  {
    <span style="color:red">File file = new File("story.txt");</span>
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(<span style="color:red">file</span>);
    int lineCount = 1;

    while (scanner.hasNextLine())
    {
      String line = scanner.nextLine();
      System.out.print(lineCount + " ");
      System.out.println(line);
      lineCount += 1;
    }
    <span style="color:red">scanner.close();</span>
  }
}

</pre>

<p>
Try this code out! To run in Eclipse, the file <a href="story.txt">story.txt</a> must be present
in the project directory.  

<p>
Try changing the filename to something invalid and
see what happens. 
When the file you've named in the <code>File</code> constructor isn't there, the program fails with a
<code>FileNotFoundException</code> when you try to create the Scanner.  You have seen some kinds of exceptions in previous labs.  The <code>FileNotFoundException</code>
is a bit different than the exceptions we've seen before, because the compiler requires us to declare in the method heading
that this exception might occur:
<pre class="block">
  public static void main(String[] args) <span style="color:red">throws FileNotFoundException</span>
</pre>

<p>
The main change is the way that we construct the <code>Scanner</code>. First, we
create a <code>File</code> object by giving the constructor the name of the file we
want to read.  Then we use the <code>File</code> object to construct our <code>Scanner</code>:
<pre class="block">
    <span style="color:red">File file = new File("story.txt");</span>
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(<span style="color:red">file</span>);
</pre>
 
When we construct the <code>Scanner</code> from the given file, the file 
is <em>opened</em>.  This means that the operating system gets involved with finding the 
actual file on the hard drive and preparing to read its contents.  When you're 
finished reading a file, you should tell the operating system you're done so that
it can clean things up (for example, most operating systems record the date and time at which a file was
last accessed).  This is called <em>closing</em> the file, which we can
do with the <code>close</code> method of the scanner:

<pre class="block">
    <span style="color:red">scanner.close();</span>
</pre>

<h3>Alternatives for opening a file</h3>

In the zyBook you may have seen a slight variation on the strategy above.  Instead of creating the Scanner from a <code>File</code> object, you can create the Scanner from an instance of <code>FileInputStream</code>.
<pre class="block">
    <span style="color:red">FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("story.txt");</span>
    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(<span style="color:red">fis</span>);
</pre>
This accomplishes the same thing.  The only subtle difference is that if there is an exception, it will occur on creating the <code>FileInputStream</code> instead of on creation of the Scanner.
<p>
In the zyBook, they also declare the more general type <code>IOException</code> instead of 
<code>FileNotFoundException</code>.  This makes no practical difference.

<h3>The File Class</h3>

<p>
The Java libraries provide a class called 
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html" target="New_Win"><code>File</code></a>
that represents an abstract file name and path. It has methods for examining
and modifying the properties of files and directories. Some useful methods of the 
<code>File</code> class are illustrated in the snippet below.

</p> 

<pre class="block">
    File file = new File("story.txt");
    System.out.println(file.exists());          // true if the file exists
    System.out.println(file.getName());         // name of the file 
    System.out.println(file.getAbsolutePath()); // absolute path to the file
    System.out.println(file.length());          // size of the file
</pre>

Try adding the lines above to your <code>main</code> method and see what 
the output is.



<!--You should see what's called a <i>stack trace</i>, which shows which method called which method which called ... which method that generated the exception. The layering of method calls that lead to a particular point in the execution of your program is known as the <i>call stack</i>, thus the name stack trace. You saw last week how you can view the call stack at any break- or watchpoint in the Eclipse debugger.
