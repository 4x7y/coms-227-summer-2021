<h2>Why Recursion?</h2>

<p>
The examples we have seen so far are all easy to implement using simple loops. 
There are many problems that are difficult using only loops, but are straightforward to solve using recursion.
 
<p>
One such example is printing out the names of <i>all</i> the files beneath a directory. Directories may contain files or other directories, which may in turn contain files or other directories,  which may in turn contain files or other directories, and so on.  There is no straightforward way of using a loop to iterate over a potentially complex hierarchy of directories to print all the filenames.

<p>
Before going further, let's notice that by contrast, it's easy to iterate over just the <em>direct</em> contents of one directory.  For example, if you open up your project from last week's lab using File Explorer or Finder, you might see a hierarchy like this:
<p>
<img src="finder_screenshot.png" width="800" alt = "Screenshot of project6 hierarchy in Finder" />
<p>
That is, you have the project directory <strong>project</strong>, which contains
five files, <strong>hello.txt</strong>, <strong>polyline_plotter.jar</strong>, <strong>scores.txt</strong>, <strong>story.txt</strong>, and <strong>test.txt</strong>.  But it also contains two <em>subdirectories</em>, <strong>src</strong> and <strong>bin</strong>.  The <strong>src</strong> directory contains one subdirectory <strong>lab6</strong>, which contains the various java files used in the lab.  The <strong>bin</strong> directory is similar.

<p>
The Java class <code>File</code> abstractly represents a pathname identifying an element of the filesystem, which could be a file or a directory, and it includes the following methods:
<ul>
<li>The <code>isDirectory()</code> method, which returns true if the <code>File</code> object represents a directory, 
and 
<li>the <code>listFiles()</code> method, which (for a directory) returns an array of <code>File</code> objects representing the directory's contents.
</ul>

Try running the following code, which should list the direct contents of the project6 directory, without attempting to go any deeper and list the contents of the src or bin directories:
<pre class="block">
package lab7;
import java.io.File;

public class FileTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    File f = new File("../project6");
    System.out.println("Does it exist? " + f.exists());
    System.out.println("Is this a directory? " + f.isDirectory());
    System.out.println();
    
    // list the direct contents of the project6 directory
    File[] files = f.listFiles();
    for (int i = 0; i < files.length; ++i)
    {
      System.out.println(files[i].getName());
    }
  }
}
</pre>
You should see output something like:
<pre>
scores.txt
bin
.classpath
.settings
story.txt
.project
polyline_plotter.jar
test.txt
hello.txt
src
</pre>
(The filenames starting with a dot are "hidden" files that are normally not shown when you examine your filesystem using File Explorer or Finder.)
<p>
The problem we are really trying to solve is not just to list the files and directory names directly contained in a directory, but to also dig down into the subdirectories and list all the files they contain, and into their subdirectories, and so on.  What we need is a method that we can call to list all files beneath, say, the <strong>bin</strong> and <strong>src</strong> directories.  

<p>
Notice that this is a recursive problem. That is, a solution to the problem can be described in terms of a solution to its sub-problems: <em>we can easily list the files below a given directory, provided we have a method to list the files below a <em>sub</em>directory.</em> 
Each item in a file hierarchy is either a file or a directory.  If it's a file, we just print its name.  If it's a directory, then iterate over the items it contains, and list each one.  
In pseudocode:
<pre>
<em>
to print a listing of all files below f 
    if f is a file
        print the file name
    else
        let arr = array of files in f
        for each item g in arr
           print listing of all files below g
</em> 
</pre>

<p>
The following code prints out the names of all files starting with the <strong>project6</strong> directory. (If you named your project for lab 6 something else, you'll need to edit the code accordingly.)  Notice the difference in the output versus the FileTest code above.  Running the FileLister below, each time a directory is encountered, we immediately jump down into it and list its contents before continuing with the files at the previous level.

<pre class="block">
package lab7;
import java.io.File;

public class FileLister
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    // Choose the directory you want to list.
    // If running in Eclipse, "." will just be the current project directory.
    // Use ".." to list the whole workspace directory, or enter a path to
    // some other directory.
    File rootDirectory = new File("../project6");

    listAllFiles(rootDirectory);
  }
  
  /**
   * Print the names of all items in the hierarchy located under 
   * a given directory. If the given File object is not a directory, 
   * just prints the file's name.
   */
  public static void listAllFiles(File f)
  {
    if (!f.isDirectory())
    {
      // Base case: f is a file, so just print its name
      System.out.println(f.getName());
    }
    else
    {
      // Recursive case: f is a directory, so go through the 
      // files and directories it contains, and recursively call
      // this method on each one
      System.out.println("+" + f.getName());
      File[] files = f.listFiles();
      for (int i = 0; i < files.length; ++i)
      {
        listAllFiles(files[i]);
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
Could you have done this with a loop?  Techincally, yes. All recursive methods <em>can</em> be written without using recursion.  However, the code is much more complex and difficult to write. To solve the file lister problem nonrecursively, you have to manually keep track of which items in which directories still need to be processed.
